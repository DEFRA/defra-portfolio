		<h3 class="heading-medium">How to get something added to the portfolio</h3>
		<ol class="list list-number">
		<li>Contact the <a href="mailto:JAMES.JOHNSON1@dwp.gsi.gov.uk">portfolio team</a></li>
		<li>Work with them to define the problem you want to solve</li>
		<li>They will help you finalise an Discovery Approval Document</li>
		<li>This document is then presented to the BTG management team who decide whether the work is added to the backlog and its priority</li>
		</ol>

		<h3 class="heading-medium">What happens next</h3>

		<p>The BTG Challenge and Support forum will bring your work out of the backlog when the right people become available.</p>
